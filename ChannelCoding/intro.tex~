\section{Introduction}
%Coverage problems lie at the core of combinatorial optimization and have been extensively studied in computer science. A quintessential example of such problems is the maximum coverage problem wherein we are given subsets $T_1, \ldots, T_m$ of a universe $[n]$ along with a positive integer $k$, and the objective is to find a size-$k$ set $S \subseteq [m]$ that maximizes the covering function $C(S) := \abs{\bigcup_{i \in S} T_i}$.
%constitute a key thread of research

Coverage functions are central objects of study in combinatorial optimization. Problems related to optimizing such functions arise in multiple fields, such as operations research~\cite{CFN77}, machine learning~\cite{FK14}, algorithmic game theory~\cite{SV15}, and information theory~\cite{BF17}. 
%Coverage problems model a very wide variety of problems in computer science and mathematics such as operations research~\cite{CFN77}, machine learning~\cite{FK14}, algorithmic game theory \cite{SV15} and information theory~\cite{BF17}. 
The most basic covering problem is the \emph{maximum coverage} one. In this problem, we are given subsets $T_1, \ldots, T_m$ of a universe $[n]$, along with a positive integer $k$, and the objective is to find a size-$k$ subset $S \subseteq [m]$ that maximizes the coverage function $C(S) \coloneqq  \abs{\bigcup_{i \in S} T_i}$. A fundamental result in the field of approximation algorithms establishes that an approximation ratio of $1-e^{-1}$ can be achieved for this problem in polynomial-time~\cite{Hochbaum96} and, in fact, this approximation guarantee is tight, under the assumption that ${\rm P} \not= {\rm NP}$~\cite{Feige98}.

%It is well-known that a natural greedy algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of $1-e^{-1}$ for
%this problem (see, e.g., \cite{Hochbaum96}). Furthermore, the work of Feige \cite{Feige98} shows that this approximation ratio is tight, under the assumption that P $\not=$ NP. Over the years, a large body of work has been directed towards extending these fundamental results and, more generally, coverage problem have been studied across multiple fields, such as operations research \cite{CFN77}, machine learning \cite{FK14}, and algorithmic game theory \cite{SV15}.

Note that in the maximum coverage problem, an element $a \in [n]$ is counted at most once in the objective, even if $a$ appears in several selected sets. However, if we think of elements $a \in [n]$ as goods or resources, there are many settings wherein the utility indeed increases with the number of copies of $a$ that get accumulated.  
%having multiple copies of the good $a$ could increase the utility.
% that is covered more than once does add a utility that increases with the number of times it is covered. 
%Thinking of elements $a \in [n]$ as goods, 
Motivated, in part, by such settings, we consider a generalization of the maximum coverage problem where an element $a$ can contribute by an amount that depends on the number of times it is covered. 

Given a function $\varphi: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$, an integer $k \in \mathbb{N}$, a universe of elements $[n]$, positive weights $w_a$ for each $a \in [n]$, and  subsets $T_1,\ldots,T_m \subseteq [n]$, the $\varphi$-\textsc{MaxCoverage} problem entails maximizing $C^{\varphi}(S) \coloneqq \sum_{a \in [n]}w_a  \varphi(\abs{S}_a)$ over subsets $S \subseteq [m]$ of cardinality at most $k$; here $\abs{S}_a = \abs{\set{i \in S : a \in T_i}}$.

This work focuses on functions $\varphi$ that are nondecreasing and concave (i.e., $\varphi(i+2) - \varphi(i+1) \leq \varphi(i+1) - \varphi(i)$ for $i \in \mathbb{N}$).\footnote{We require $\varphi$ to be defined for nonnegative integers and will extend it over $\mathbb{R}_+$ by considering its piecewise linear extension.}  We will also assume that the function $\varphi$ is normalized in the sense that $\varphi(0) = 0$ and $\varphi(1) = 1$.\footnote{One can always replace a generic $\varphi$ to a normalized one without changing the optimal solutions through a simple affine transformation.} Our approximation guarantees are in terms of the \emph{Poisson concavity ratio} of $\varphi$, which we define as follows 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:def-alpha-varphi}
\alpha_{\varphi} := \inf_{x \in \mathbb{N}} \ \frac{\mathbb{E}[\varphi(\Poi(x))]}{\varphi(\mathbb{E}[\Poi(x)])} =  \inf_{x \in \mathbb{N}} \ \frac{\mathbb{E}[\varphi(\Poi(x))]}{\varphi(x)} \ .
\end{align} 

Here $\Poi(x)$ denotes a Poisson-distributed random variable with parameter $x$. We will write $\alpha_{\varphi}(x) \coloneqq \frac{\mathbb{E}[\varphi(\Poi(x))]}{\varphi(x)}$ and, hence, $\alpha_{\varphi}  = \inf_{x \in \mathbb{N}} \alpha_{\varphi}(x) $. 

Our main result is that the $\varphi$-\textsc{MaxCoverage} problem admits an efficient $\alpha_\varphi$-approximation algorithm, when $\varphi$ is normalized nondecreasing concave, and this approximation guarantee is tight when $\varphi$ grows sublinearly. Formally,  

\begin{theo*}
For any normalized nondecreasing concave function $\varphi$, there exists a polynomial-time $\alpha_\varphi$-approximation algorithm for the $\varphi$-\textsc{MaxCoverage} problem. Furthermore, for $\varphi(n) = o(n)$, it is {\rm NP}-hard to approximate the $\varphi$-\textsc{MaxCoverage} problem within a factor better than $\alpha_\varphi + \varepsilon$, for any constant $\varepsilon >0$.
\label{theo:main}
\end{theo*}

Before detailing the proof of the theorem, we provide a few remarks and connections to related work.


\paragraph{Applications and related work}
%Problems of $\varphi$-covering appear in many setups, sometimes under different names.
%\textsc{MaxCoverage}
We can directly reduce  the standard  maximum coverage problem to $\varphi$-\textsc{MaxCoverage} by setting $\varphi(j) = \min\{ j,1\}$. In this case $\alpha_{\varphi} = 1 - e^{-1}$. One can also encapsulate, within our framework, the $\ell$-\textsc{MultiCoverage} problem studied in~\cite{BFGG20} by instantiating $\varphi(j) = \min\{ j,\ell\}$. In this setting, we recover the approximation ratio $\alpha_{\varphi} = 1-\frac{\ell^{\ell}e^{-\ell}}{\ell!}$, which matches the approximation guarantee obtained in~\cite{BFGG20} (see Proposition \ref{prop:lCover}). Note that the hardness result in~\cite{BFGG20} was based on the Unique Games Conjecture, whereas the current work proves that this guarantee is tight under ${\rm P} \not= {\rm NP}$. %OLD% We refer the reader to~\cite{BF17,BFGG20} for more details on this connection.}

%OLD%---The , another formulation of the $\varphi$-\textsc{MaxCoverage} was studied, in the context of multi-winner approval-based voting rules. The utility of a voter from a committee in which he or she approves $j$ candidates is equal to $\varphi(j)$. The goal is to find a committee of $k$ candidates that maximizes the total utility of the voters. Specifically, they look at $w$-\textsc{Thiele} rules, where $w = (w_1,w_2,\ldots)$ is linked to our definition by $w_i = \varphi(i)-\varphi(i-1)$. They proved that in the particular case where the sequence $w$ satisfies $w_{i} w_{i+2} \geq w_{i}^2$ for all $i$ (a condition they call geometrical domination) as well as $\lim_{i \rightarrow +\infty} w_i = 0$  (equivalent to $\varphi(n) = o(n)$; see Property \ref{prop:thieleEqLim}), then Theorem \ref{theo:main} holds. In particular, they get the ratio $\mathbb{E}[\varphi(\Poi(1))] = \alpha_{\varphi}(1)$, which means that their geometrical dominance property is a sufficient condition to have $\alpha_{\varphi} = \alpha_{\varphi}(1)$. Their particular case applies to the well studied \textsc{Proportional Approval Voting} rule (when $w_i = \frac{1}{i}$; see e.g. \cite{BSS17}).
%, and improves its best know approximation ratio. 

Another application of $\varphi$-\textsc{MaxCoverage} is in the context of multiwinner elections that entail selecting $k$ (out of $m$) candidates with the objective of maximizing the cumulative utility of $n$ voters; here, the utility of each voter $a \in [n]$ increases as more and more approved (by $a$) candidates get selected. One can reduce multiwinner elections to a coverage problem by considering subset $T_i \subseteq [n]$ as the set of voters that approve of candidate $i \in [m]$ and $\varphi(j)$ as the utility that an agent achieves from $j$ approved selections.\footnote{Indeed, for a subset of candidates $S \subseteq [m]$, the utility of a voter $a \in [n]$ is equal to $\varphi ( \abs{S}_a)$, with $\abs{S}_a = \abs{\set{i \in S : a \in T_i}}$.} Addressing multiwinner elections in this standard utilitarian model, Dudycz et al.~\cite{DDMS20} obtain tight approximation guarantees for some well-studied classes of utilities. Specifically, the result in \cite{DDMS20} applies to the classic \emph{proportional approval voting rule}, which assigns a utility of $\sum_{i=1}^j \frac{1}{i}$ for $j$ approved selections. This voting rule corresponds to the coverage problem with $\varphi(j) = \sum_{i=1}^j \frac{1}{i}$. Section~\ref{subsection:multiwinner-election} shows that Theorem \ref{theo:main} holds for all the settings considered in \cite{DDMS20} and, in fact, applies more generally. In particular, the voting version of $\ell$-\textsc{MultiCoverage} (studied in \cite{Skowron2016}) can be addressed by Theorem \ref{theo:main}, but not by the result in~\cite{DDMS20}. Such a separation also arises when one truncates the proportional approval voting rule to, say, $\ell$ candidates, i.e., upon setting $\varphi(j) = \sum_{i=1}^{\min \{ j, \ell\}} \frac{1}{i}$. Given that multiwinner elections model multiple real-world settings (e.g., committee selection \cite{Skowron2016} and parliamentary proceedings \cite{Brill2018}), instantiations of $\varphi$-\textsc{MaxCoverage} in such social-choice contexts substantiate the applicability of our algorithmic result. % in the field of computation social choice. 


%OLD%--Note that our result does not make use of the geometrical dominance property and it applies to all $w$-\textsc{Thiele} rules. Note that many natural choices of $\varphi$ (or $w$-\textsc{Thiele} rules) do not have the geometrical dominance property, in particular the $\ell$-\textsc{MultiCoverage} problem, but more generally any function $\varphi$ that is eventually constant (or equivalently the sequence $w$ is eventually zero). % and especially cases where the minimum is not taken at $1$, as the $\ell$-\textsc{MultiCoverage} problem.

Coverage functions arise in numerous resource-allocation settings, such as sensor allocation~\cite{marden2008distributed}, job scheduling, and plant location ~\cite{cornnejols1977location}. The goal, broadly, in such setups is to select $k$ subsets of resources (out of $m$ pre-specified ones) such that the \emph{welfare} generated by the selected resources is maximized--each resource's contribution to the welfare increases with the number of times it is selected. This problem can be cast as $\varphi$-\textsc{MaxCoverage} by setting $n$ to be the number of resources, $\{T_i\}_{i\in [m]}$ as the given collection of subsets, and $\varphi(j)$ to be the welfare contribution of a resource when it is covered $j$ times.\footnote{Formally, to capture specific welfare-maximization problems in their entirety we have to a consider $\varphi$-\textsc{MaxCoverage} with a matroid constraint, and not just bound the number of selected subsets by $k$. Details pertaining to matroid constraints and the reduction appear in Section~\ref{sec:matroid} and~\ref{subsection:welfare-maximization}, respectively.}  Here, we mention a specific allocation problem to highlight the relevance of studying $\varphi$ beyond the standard coverage and $\ell$-coverage formulations (see Section \ref{subsection:vehicle-target} for details): in the \textsc{Vehicle-Target Assignment} problem~\cite{Murphey00,PM19} the resources are $n$ targets and covering a target $j$ times contributes $\varphi^p(j) = \frac{1-(1-p)^j}{p}$ to the welfare; here, $p \in (0,1)$ is a given parameter. Interestingly, we find that for this problem, the approximation ratio $\alpha_{\varphi}$ we obtain can outperform the \emph{Price of Anarchy} (PoA), which corresponds to the approximation ratio of any algorithm where the agents selfishly maximize their utilities (see Section~\ref{subsection:vehicle-target} for further discussion of this point). This is to be contrasted with the resource allocation problem with $\varphi(j) = \min\{j, \ell\}$ for which it was shown in~\cite{CPM19} that the Price of Anarchy matches with $\alpha_{\varphi}$.
%This is to be contrasted with $\ell$-\textsc{MultiCoverage} for which it was shown that the Price of Anarchy matches $\alpha_{\varphi}$ \cite{CPM19}.
%However, despite that the PoA strategy matches $\alpha_{\varphi}$ for the $\ell$-\textsc{MultiCoverage} problem \cite{CPM19}, we show in Section \ref{subsection:vehicle-target} that this inequality can be strict, in the particular example of the \textsc{Vehicle-Target Assignment} problem.
Another allocation problem studied in \cite{PM19} corresponds to $\varphi$-\textsc{MaxCoverage} with $\varphi(j) = j^d$, for a given parameter $d \in (0,1)$. We refer to this instantiation as the $d$-Power function. 

%%The above-mentioned allocation settings have also been studied from game-theoretic perspectives; see, e.g.,~\cite{gairing2009covering,CPM19}. A primary goal in this thread of work is to bound the welfare loss incurred due to strategic behavior, such as the (strategic) selection of the $k$ subsets by $k$ self-interested agents. The loss is quantified in terms of the \emph{price of anarchy} (PoA). Formally, this performance metric is defined as ratio between the welfare of the worst-possible equilibria and the optimal welfare. Note that, for the resource-allocation games at hand, our hardness result (Theorem~\ref{theo:main}) provides upper bounds on PoA of equilibrium concepts  that are computationally tractable--this follows observation that computing an equilibrium corresponds to a specific method for finding a coverage solution. 
   

%OLD$----In addition, our results can be applied to the problem of utility design for distributed resource allocation~\cite{PM19}. In fact, it is a special case of maximizing $C^\varphi$ subject to a matroid constraint and Theorem~\ref{theo:main} readily extends to matroid constraints (see Section~\ref{sec:matroid} for details).
%the problem of utility design for distributed resource allocation---introduced in \cite{PM19}---is a special case of maximizing $C^\varphi$ subject to a matroid constraint. As an example,  corresponds to such a maximization problem with $\varphi^p(j) = \frac{1-(1-p)^j}{p}$, with given parameter $p \in (0,1)$. Here, the Poisson concavity ratio and, hence, our approximation ratio is $\alpha_{\varphi^p} = \frac{1 - e^{-p}}{p}$; see Property \ref{prop:VTA}. This bound is slightly better than the numerical approximation ratio obtained in \cite{PM19} for a particular set of instances. Another case studied in \cite{PM19} is $\varphi(j) = j^d$, for a parameter $d \in (0,1)$, which we refer to as the $d$-Power function. For such functions, we have $\alpha_{\varphi} = e^{-1}\sum_{k=1}^{+\infty}\frac{k^d}{k!}$ (Property \ref{prop:dPower}). This approximation ratio seems to match the empirical bounds shown in \cite{PM19} for certain problem instances. \OF{This should be a bit more precise, is what they plot really an approximation ratio of a PoA? In any case, in the intro, this should be short and we should refer to the main text for more details.}
Theorem~\ref{theo:main} gives us a tight approximation bound of $\alpha_{\varphi}$ for all the above-mentioned applications of $\varphi$-\textsc{MaxCoverage}. The values of $\alpha_{\varphi}$ for these instantiations are listed in Table \ref{figComp}. 

%The above-mentioned results are summarized in Table. 
%\OF{Could we add to this table truncated versions of some of these? For ex proportional voting of the $j^d$... It's better if we have a closed form but even if just a numerical value would be ok.}

\paragraph{Remarks on the {Poisson concavity ratio} $\alpha_{\varphi}$}
By Jensen's inequality along with the nonnegativity and concavity of $\varphi$, we have that $\alpha_{\varphi} \in [0,1]$. We note that for an instance with $m$ sets, one can obtain an  approximation ratio equal to $\min_{x \in [m]} \alpha_{\varphi}(x)$, which can be larger in some cases.

One can compare the approximation factor obtained here with the factor that comes from the notion of curvature of submodular functions. In fact, if $\varphi$ is nondecreasing and concave, then $C^{\varphi}$ is submodular. One can show, via a direct calculation, that for submodular $C^{\varphi}$ the curvature (as defined in \cite{CC84}) is given by $c = 1 - (\varphi(m) - \varphi(m-1))$; see Proposition \ref{prop:SubCurv}. Therefore, the algorithm of Sviridenko et al.~\cite{SVW17} leads to an approximation ratio of $1 - c e^{-1}$ for the $\varphi$-\textsc{MaxCoverage} problem. We note that the {Poisson concavity ratio} $\alpha_{\varphi}$ is always greater or equal to this curvature-dependent ratio (Proposition \ref{prop:BetterRatio}). Specifically, for $p$-\textsc{Vehicle-Target Assignment}, it is strictly better for all $p \not=0,1$ and for $\ell$-\textsc{MultiCoverage}, it is strictly better for all $\ell \geq 2$ as remarked in \cite{BFGG20}. Therefore, for the setting at hand, the current work improves the approximation guarantee obtained in \cite{SVW17}. 


\paragraph{Proof techniques and organization}
In Section \ref{section:ApproxAlgo}, we present our approximation algorithm for the $\varphi$-\textsc{MaxCoverage}. The algorithm is an application of \emph{pipage rounding}, a technique introduced in \cite{AS04}, on a linear programming relaxation of $\varphi$-\textsc{MaxCoverage}. We show that the multilinear extension $F^{\varphi}$ of $C^{\varphi}$ is efficiently computable and thus, we can compute an integer solution $x^{\text{int}}$ from the optimal fractional one $x^*$ satisfying $C^{\varphi}(x^{\text{int}}) \geq F^{\varphi}(x^*)$. Using the notion of \emph{convex order} between distributions, we show that $F^{\varphi}(x^*) \geq \sum_{a \in [n]} w_a \mathbb{E}[\varphi(\Poi(|x^*|_a))]$, where $|x|_{a} = \sum_{i \in [m] : a \in T_i} x_i$. Comparing this to the value $\sum_{a \in [n]} w_a \varphi(|x^*|_a)$ taken by the linear program, we get a ratio given by the \emph{Poisson concavity ratio} $\alpha_{\varphi}$. The concavity of $\varphi$ is crucial at several steps of the proof: it guarantees that the natural relaxation can be written as a linear program, it is used to relate between sums of Bernouilli random variables and a Poisson random variable via the convex order, as well as for the fact that we can restrict the infimum in the definition of $\alpha_{\varphi}$ to integer values of $x$. The generalization to matroid constraints follows in a standard way and is presented in Section \ref{sec:matroid}.

In Section \ref{section:Hardness}, we present the hardness result for $\varphi$-\textsc{MaxCoverage}. 
%the approximation $\alpha_{\varphi}$ is tight under the hypothesis P $\not=$ NP and $\varphi(n)=o(n)$.
%Note that if $\varphi(n) \not= o(n)$, the $\varphi$-\textsc{MaxCoverage} problem may be solved exactly in polynomial time for some specific $\varphi$, as for instance with $\varphi(n)=n$.
For this, we define a generalization of the partitioning gadget of Feige \cite{Feige98}, extending also \cite{BFGG20}. Roughly speaking, for an integer $x_{\varphi} \in \mathbb{N}$, it is a collection of $x_{\varphi}$-covers  of the set $[n]$ (an $x$-cover is a collection of subsets such that each element $a \in [n]$ is covered $x$ times, or in other words, its $\varphi$-coverage is $\varphi(x)n$) that are incompatible in the sense that if we take an element from each one of these $x_{\varphi}$-covers, then the $\varphi$-coverage is bounded approximately by $\mathbb{E}[\varphi(\Poi(x_{\varphi}))] n$. Then, we construct an instance of $\varphi$-\textsc{MaxCoverage} from an instance of the {\rm NP}-hard problem \emph{Label Cover} (as in \cite{DDMS20}) using such a gadget with $x_{\varphi} \in \text{argmin}_{x \in \mathbb{N}} \alpha_{\varphi}(x)$. Having set up the partitioning gadget, the analysis of the reduction can be obtained by carefully generalizing the reductions of~\cite{BFGG20} and~\cite{DDMS20}.
%We construct it around the notion of $x$-cover with $x \in \mathbb{N}$, which will lead to an $\alpha_{\varphi}(x)$ approximation hardness, combining the idea of \cite{BFGG20} to the NP-hard problem \emph{Label Cover} used in \cite{DDMS20}. 
%We naturally take $x_{\varphi} \in \text{argmin}_{x \in \mathbb{N}} \alpha_{\varphi}(x)$ to achieve the $\alpha_{\varphi}$ approximation hardness. The guarantee that $\alpha_{\varphi}$ is coming from integer ratios, thanks to the precise analysis of the approximation algorithm, is crucial to define the notion of $x$-cover, which is a combinatorial object which has no meaning for fractional or real $x$.

In Section \ref{section:applications}, we present different domains of application of our result.


%In Section \ref{section:applications}, we present different domains of application of our result. 
%In particular, for the problem of Resource Allocation in Multiagent Systems, introduced in \cite{PM19}, we show in Section \ref{subsection:welfare-maximization} that $\alpha_{\varphi}$ is also the optimal approximation ratio under the hypothesis that ${\rm P} \not= {\rm NP}$. 
%As a consequence, we get an upper bound on the \emph{Price of Anarchy} (PoA), the loss of having self-interested agents maximizing their utilities instead of taking the global optimal solution, since in that setting, this local strategy can be computed efficiently \cite{CPM19}. However, despite that the PoA strategy matches $\alpha_{\varphi}$ for the $\ell$-\textsc{MultiCoverage} problem \cite{CPM19}, we show in Section \ref{subsection:vehicle-target} that this inequality can be strict, in the particular example of the \textsc{Vehicle-Target Assignment} problem.

%This project was started independently of the paper~\cite{DDMS20}. Before~\cite{DDMS20} appeared, we already had the algorithm for any nondecreasing and concave $\varphi$ and unique games hardness for bounded $\varphi$. We used some of the ideas in~\cite{DDMS20} to improve the hardness to an {\rm NP}-hardness result and to extend it to sublinear $\varphi$.
%The algorithm in the general case was found independently from the one found in \cite{DDMS20}, whereas the hardness result was found using some of their ideas.
