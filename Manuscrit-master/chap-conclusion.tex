In this thesis, we have studied several channel coding problems, with and without non-signaling assistance, from the points of view of algorithmic approximation and  capacity regions.

TODO (concise = 1 page)

-Sum up quickly conclusions (like the abstract size more or less)

-Recall quickly local open questions

-Open on the global idea of the thesis of the links between approximation algorithms and capacity regions, etc. Extend idea to general games or whatosever...
