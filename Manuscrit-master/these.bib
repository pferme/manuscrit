  abstract  = {Lots of revocable group signature schemes have been proposed so far. In one type of revocable schemes, signing and/or verifying algorithms have O(N) or O(R) complexity, where N is the group size and R is the number of revoked members. On the other hand, in Camenisch-Lysyanskaya scheme and the followers, signing and verifying algorithms have O(1) complexity. However, before signing, updates of the secret key are required. The complexity is O(R) in the worst case. In this paper, we propose a revocable scheme with signing and verifying of O(1) complexity, where no updates of secret key are required. The compensation is the long public key of O(N). In addition, we extend it to the scheme with                                                                           {\$}O({\backslash}sqrt{\{}N{\}}){\$}                -size public key, where signing and verifying have constant extra costs.},

If the identification scheme is random self-reducible and satisfies the weakest possible security notion (hardness of key-recoverability), then the signature scheme obtained via Fiat-Shamir is unforgeable against chosen-message attacks in the multi-user setting. Our security reduction is in the random oracle model and loses a factor of roughly                                                                                   {\$}{\$}Q{\_}h{\$}{\$}                  , the number of hash queries. Previous reductions incorporated an additional multiplicative loss of N, the number of users in the system. Our analysis is done in small steps via intermediate security notions, and all our implications have relatively simple proofs. Furthermore, for each step, we show the optimality of the given reduction in terms of model assumptions and tightness.},

Previous lattice schemes in the standard model with similarly short signatures, due to Boyen (PKC 2010) and Micciancio and Peikert (Eurocrypt 2012), had substantially longer public keys consisting of $\Omega$(n) vectors (even when implemented with ideal lattices).},

The construction is provably secure based on the worst-case hardness of approximating the shortest vector in such lattices within a polynomial factor, and it is also asymptotically efficient: the time complexity of the signing and verification algorithms, as well as key and signature size is almost linear (up to poly-logarithmic factors) in the dimension n of the underlying lattice. Since no sub-exponential (in n) time algorithm is known to solve lattice problems in the worst case, even when restricted to cyclic lattices, our construction gives a digital signature scheme with an essentially optimal performance/security trade-off.},

  abstract  = {We present new candidates for quantum-resistant public-key cryptosystems based on the conjectured difficulty of finding isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves. The main technical idea in our scheme is that we transmit the images of torsion bases under the isogeny in order to allow the two parties to arrive at a common shared key despite the noncommutativity of the endomorphism ring. Our work is motivated by the recent development of a subexponential-time quantum algorithm for constructing isogenies between ordinary elliptic curves. In the supersingular case, by contrast, the fastest known quantum attack remains exponential, since the noncommutativity of the endomorphism ring means that the approach used in the ordinary case does not apply. We give a precise formulation of the necessary computational assumption along with a discussion of its validity. In addition, we present implementation results showing that our protocols are multiple orders of magnitude faster than previous isogeny-based cryptosystems over ordinary curves.},

Our identification protocol relies on the hardness of the endomorphism ring computation problem, arguably the hardest of all problems in this area, whereas the only previous scheme based on isogenies (due to De Feo, Jao and Pl{\^u}t) relied on potentially easier problems. The protocol makes novel use of an algorithm of Kohel-Lauter-Petit-Tignol for the quaternion version of the                                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}ell {\$}{\$}                                                                  ℓ                                                            -isogeny problem, for which we provide a more complete description and analysis. Our new signature schemes are derived from the identification protocols using the Fiat-Shamir (respectively, Unruh) transforms for classical (respectively, post-quantum) security. We study their efficiency, highlighting very small key sizes and reasonably efficient signing and verification algorithms.},
