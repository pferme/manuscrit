P NP classes?
Hardness reductions?
General probability theory?
General Intro on Information Theory? With definitions of entropies etc. 

Put non-signaling basic properties

Put general definition of channel $W$ with several inputs/outputs with $\mathcal{X}^n \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}^m$: specialization in different parts ($n=m=1$,$n=1,m=2$,$n=2,m=1$) (remove first paragraph of MAC and Broadcast)

Put typical set properties for 1 and 2 parties

Put common lemmas and general stuff: convex order (3.3), negatively associated random variables: recall important properties etc. (clean 3.5.4 with that and Prop 5.15 moved to intro)

General capacity region $\mathcal{C}_{\textrm{S}}(W)$ from of success probability $\textrm{S}(W,k_1,k_2)$ and zero error capacity region (easy to define and clean way to generalize)

Hypothesis Testing on probas

Finish proof of 4.72 (put calculus here)

Put back results from BF18 in the background part

Graph notations on partitions?
